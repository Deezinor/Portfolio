# Optional: if you only want small, web-ready models in Git,
# you can allow a lightweight demo folder and ignore the rest:
# (uncomment these two lines if you adopt this pattern)
# assets/models/**
# !assets/models/demo/**

# If you use image-based lighting, keep only final, *small* HDRIs
# and ignore working files (EXR, massive HDRs, etc.)
*.exr
# keep: small .hdr if genuinely needed for the web build
