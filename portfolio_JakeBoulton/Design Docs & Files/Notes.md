## GoFish

- It was a mixed reality recreation of the classic card game gofish
- More context here: https://devpost.com/software/go-fish-yneg1h
- The concept was to play GoFish wish friends but instead of picking up when you had to go fish, you would pick up a fishing rod and fish out of the water in front of you

## Habibi

- It was a tool for long-distance communication bewteen two partners where you had a shared wall you could leave notes, images, and more on.
- It had AI-intergration for image generation as well.

## Midnight at the Pagoda

- The brief was to pick one of 3 project areas (ours was the history of buddhism in China) and then create a XR exhibit with the winning project being developed and launched in the Great Bao'en Temple in Nanjing, China where the Hackathon took place
- The heritage site was the Porcelain Tower and The Great Bao'en Temple in Nanjing.

## Beatbox

- It won the Jury Prize at the Innovate UK Immersive Tech Awards in 2024

## Caspian House

- Yes this is a digital twin of my own house. I would like to find a secure way of saying that though...

## Altilium

- This was my final year project on my Product Design degree.
- The idea was a portable induction stove (conceptul as the battery technology at the time was yet mass marketed and I still dont think it is. I was looking at using Solid State Batteries)
- It was designed with the intent of reducing the risk of fire at campsites.
