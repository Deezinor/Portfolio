**Timeline:** 3 months planning/design + 3 days hackathon development
**Team:** Joshua Davies, Hwanjoon Jang, Mai Ye (Nathan not involved)
**Role:** Lead XR Designer and Artist
**RoleDetails:** Historical research, 3D asset creation, Environment design, UI/UX design

## Habibi

**Description:** A shared virtual wall for long-distance couples to communicate asynchronously. Partners can leave notes, upload images, and use AI-powered image generation to create and share visual moments together, fostering connection across distance through a persistent shared space.

**Challenge:** Creating meaningful connection for long-distance partners through asynchronous communication that goes beyond standard messaging apps, incorporating creative expression through AI tools.

**Solution:** Built a VR application with a persistent shared wall space where partners can leave handwritten notes, share photos, and generate AI images together, creating an ongoing visual dialogue that persists between sessions.

**Timeline:** 3 day hackathon (XR Hack 2024: Istanbul)
**Team:** Joshua Davies, Hwanjoon Jang, Mai Ye, Mohammed El Eryan (Nathan not involved)
**Role:** Lead XR Designer and Artist  
**RoleDetails:** Concept development, 3D asset creation, AI integration design, UI/UX design

## GoFish

**Description:** A mixed reality recreation of the classic card game Go Fish, reimagined for VR. Players sit around a virtual table playing cards, but instead of simply "going fish" from the deck, they physically fish with a rod into virtual water to catch their cards, adding tactile fun to the classic game.

**Challenge:** Translating a simple card game into an engaging VR experience that justifies the medium, making the physical act of "going fish" literal and enjoyable while maintaining the social card game feel.

**Solution:** Created a VR card table environment where players use fishing rods to catch cards from virtual water when told to "go fish", combining traditional card game mechanics with satisfying physical VR interactions.

**Timeline:** 3 day hackathon  
**Team:** Joshua Davies, Hwanjoon Jang, Nathan Thomas-Benke, Mai Ye
**Role:** Lead XR Designer and Artist
**RoleDetails:** Concept development, 3D asset creation, Interaction design, Environment design

## Caspian House

**Description:** A personal architectural visualization project creating a digital twin of a residential interior. Focused on accurate material representation, lighting, and spatial atmosphere to practice photorealistic rendering techniques.

**Challenge:** Translating real-world architectural space into a convincing digital environment while learning lighting, material creation, and composition for architectural visualization.

**Solution:** Built a detailed 3D interior environment matching real-world proportions and materials, focusing on realistic lighting scenarios and material accuracy to create believable architectural renders.

**Timeline:** Personal project duration
**Team:** Solo project
**Role:** 3D Artist
**RoleDetails:** 3D modeling, Material creation, Lighting design, Rendering

## Altilium

**Description:** A portable induction stove concept designed for camping and outdoor use, exploring future battery technology (solid-state batteries) to create a safer cooking solution. Final year product design degree project focused on reducing campsite fire risks while maintaining cooking functionality.

**Challenge:** Designing a portable cooking solution for camping that eliminates open flames and gas canisters, exploring emerging battery technology to create a safer alternative to traditional camp stoves.

**Solution:** Developed a concept for a battery-powered induction stove with removable battery packs, focusing on form factor, material selection, and user interaction while researching solid-state battery technology feasibility.

**Timeline:** Final year project (full academic term)
**Team:** Solo project
**Role:** Product Designer
**RoleDetails:** Research, Concept development, CAD modeling, Technical drawings, Materials research

## GS Weapons

**Description:** A collection of detailed 3D weapon models created as coursework for a university modeling and animation module, showcasing hard-surface modeling, texturing, and rendering techniques. Based on concept art reference to practice translating 2D designs into 3D assets.

**Challenge:** Creating high-quality weapon assets demonstrating technical proficiency in hard-surface modeling, UV unwrapping, and PBR texturing workflows within a limited timeframe.

**Solution:** Developed a series of weapon models using industry-standard techniques, including detailed high-poly modeling, efficient low-poly optimization, and professional texturing in Substance Painter, working from concept art reference.

**Timeline:** 1 month (coursework)
**Team:** Solo project
**Role:** 3D Artist
**RoleDetails:** 3D Modeling, Texturing, Rendering

## Mon58

**Description:** A digital twin practice project recreating the Mon58 house by Associati architects. Using architectural plans and reference imagery to build an accurate 3D visualization of this modern residential space, focusing on architectural accuracy and interior visualization.

**Challenge:** Translating 2D architectural plans and photographs into an accurate 3D digital twin while maintaining proportions, materials, and spatial relationships.

**Solution:** Built a detailed 3D model using reference plans and images, focusing on accurate interior visualization including kitchen, living spaces, and architectural details.

**Timeline:** Personal practice project
**Team:** Solo project
**Role:** 3D Artist
**RoleDetails:** 3D modeling, Interior visualization, Material recreation

## Savernake

**Description:** A rapid knife visualization project completed in a single day to demonstrate modeling and rendering capabilities for a job application. Based on product imagery from the Savernake brand website, recreated to showcase technical speed and quality.

**Challenge:** Creating a portfolio-quality product visualization under extreme time constraints (24 hours) to demonstrate workflow efficiency and technical capability to potential employers.

**Solution:** Rapidly modeled, textured, and rendered a product-accurate 3D knife visualization using reference photography, delivering the result as part of a speculative job application demonstrating initiative and skill.
